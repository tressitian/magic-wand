# Enclosure Notes

## Materials  
The enclosure is 3D-printed using **PLA**, a lightweight and biodegradable thermoplastic material commonly used for prototyping. PLA was chosen for its ease of printing, durability, and smooth surface finish, making it ideal for a handheld device like a wand.

## Design Decisions  
The core idea behind the enclosure design was to transform an ordinary, everyday object into something whimsical and interactive. Inspired by the form of a **pencil**, the wand is shaped to resemble a classic wooden pencil but reimagined as a magical tool.  
This playful design not only makes the device more approachable and engaging, but also subtly blends into educational or creative settings.  

The internal structure was modeled to:
- Securely house the **ESP32 board**, **MPU6050 sensor**, **RGB LEDs**, and **battery**
- Ensure the wand is balanced and comfortable to hold
- Leave space for button interaction and light diffusion

## Battery  
The device is powered by a **3.7V lithium-ion battery**.  
This battery was selected for its:
- Rechargeable capability  
- Compact size  
- Adequate energy density for continuous usage during gesture recognition and testing demos
